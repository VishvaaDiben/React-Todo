This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `installation guide for beginners`

Press the clone repository button and copy the url.
Open Ide's terminal or cmd or and redirect to a preferred location and folder name.
Paste the copied link (eg. 'git clone ...') and run.
Change directory or cd into created folder and hit command npm install.
Then follow guide bellow npm start.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If it opens as http://localhost:3000/React-Todo , remove React-Todo and only run as http://localhost:3000 and test.
Eventhough tried deploy as:
https://vishvaadiben.github.io/React-Todo/
https://react-todoish.netlify.app/
An configuration error on routing because using BrowserRouter, will find the cause, as now run as localhost. 

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `missing features`
Auth Login, because still new to swagger api. Not understand yet data post and fetch.
Tried PrivateRoute but not complete yet.

##  `all & more features to be added soon`
Will be using this as playground to restructure and rebuild Todo and possibly add more features. A good ground to exercise react elements.
